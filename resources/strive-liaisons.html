    <p>Divisional Advisors are Faculty Associates of a residential college who are selected and engaged by College
        Masters to provide academic advising to students prior to their declaration of major. Each Divisional Advisor
        serves their residential college by representing one of the four major undergraduate academic divisions:
        humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.* Divisional Advisors are trained by and work
        closely with the Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to keep up to date on academic rules and regulations,
        graduation requirements, educational opportunities, academic resources, and other important or time-sensitive
        information. Divisional Advising may include a wide range of topics including personal interests, course
        choices, short and long term plans, and co-curricular opportunities, to name a few. Divisional Advisors have
        tremendous knowledge, insights, and experiences to share, but they do not have expertise in all majors, so they
        will often also refer students to Major Advisors in academic departments or advisors in collaborative offices
        across campus (ex. Center for Career Development, Study Abroad, Office of Fellowships and Undergraduate
        Research, Center for Civic Leadership, etc.).</p><br>
