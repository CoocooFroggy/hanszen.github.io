<p><strong>STRIVE Liaisons</strong></p>

<p> The goals of the STRIVE Liaisons are to raise awareness within the college about the issue of sexual assault 
and to prepare Hanszenites with the tools they need to become allies and prevent sexual assault in the future. 
They work with the Title IX office on campus to understand the intricacies of the issue as it pertains to college 
campuses and Rice in particular. They also serve as confidential resources to listen to Hanszenites and, if requested, 
connect them to other resources at Rice and/or off campus in Houston that will support them and help them report 
incidences of sexual assault if they so choose.
