<p>RHAs are the student members who are on hand at each college to answer basic health and wellness-related
    questions. They act as a liaison between the Wellness Center and its associated programming throughout the
    semester. Regular meetings keep membership informed and allow for planning and evaluation of on-campus health
    education programs.</p>

<p>Rice Health Advisors also keep a first aid kit in their rooms. Students are welcome to stop by to pick up
    supplies, ask questions about health and wellness topics, discuss a personal problem or issue in a confidential
    setting, learn more about getting involved with the organization, or connect with the Student Wellbeing Office,
    Student Health Services or the Rice Counseling Center.</p>

    website!</p><br>
