<p><strong>Rice Health Advisors (RHAs)</strong></p>

<p>Rice Health Advisors, or RHAs, are students who have been trained on a variety of wellbeing topics. These students work 
at their college to provide health education opportunities, health supplies and peer guidance.  RHAs also act as a liaison 
between the Student Wellbeing Office and the residential colleges, staying up to date on campus-wide wellbeing programming.
Itâ€™s important to note that while the RHAs do provide health supplies like bandaids and other first aid supplies, they are 
mainly here for your mental health and wellbeing. Feel free to contact them or go and talk to them if you need some guidance, 
need health supplies, or just want to chat! Or meet them at one of the events or study breaks they host throughout the year!
Note: RHAs will direct students to the Wellness Center, Health Services or the Rice Counseling Center as appropriate.</p>
