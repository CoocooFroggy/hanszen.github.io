    <p>Each residential college has an Academic Fellows or Mentors Society, an honorary service organization dedicated
        to academic life in the college. Fellows or Mentors are upperclassmen who have: <br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>Proven academic achievement</li>
        <li>College citizenship</li>
        <li>Interest in the academic life of their College</li>
        <li>Willingness to help other students</li>
    </ol>
    </p><br>

    <p>As part of their charge, Fellows and Mentors Societies provide academic assistance on a regular basis through
        advertised review sessions, "office hours" or requested individual meetings. Two major advantages of consulting
        a Fellow or Mentor are: <br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>Convenience and proximity of source</li>
        <li>The familiarity of the Fellow or Mentor with the specific course. Students should consult the list of
            Academic Fellows and Mentors at their respective colleges.
        </li>
    </ol>
