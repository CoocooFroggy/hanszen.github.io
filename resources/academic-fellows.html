<p>Hey Hanszen! If you're ever having any trouble in any class, want someone to proofread your paper
    for free, or just want some help with homework/studying for tests, come visit your Hanszen Fellows!
    The Fellows are a group of juniors and seniors who hold review sessions, read papers, and help out
    with whatever academic needs you may have! We are also going to hold some great lectures, research
    events, and study breaks this year, so get excited!
