title: Peer Academic Advisors
categories: ['resources']
---

<p>The Peer Academic Advisors (PAAs) consist of your fellow Hanszenites who have been trained by the 
Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to help you choose classes, clarify academic rules and regulations, 
assist in finding research opportunities and study abroad information, and anything else academically related. 
In addition, the PAAs also facilitate a number of academic events at Hanszen, usually in the form of academic
planning sessions, where Hanszenites come together and help each other choose  classes for the next term. During 
O-Week, four Hanszen PAAs will be present to help the incoming students narrow down which courses they want to 
take and create their fall schedule. Once the school year starts, about twenty Hanszen PAAs will be available to 
answer questions about deadlines, registration, rules, and any other academic questions. They really are here to 
help you, so if you have any questions or just need solid academic advice, feel free to knock on their doors or 
send them an email. If they can't find an answer for you, they'll find someone who can.</p> <br> <br>
