    <p>Peer Academic Advisors, or “PAAs”, are students that have been broadly trained in numerous areas of academic life
        here at Rice and serve as liaisons between students, faculty advisors, and the Office of Academic Advising.
        Generally speaking, college PAA teams coordinate numerous group and individual activities that attempt to
        strengthen the academic vitality at their respective residential colleges. They offer accurate advice regarding:<br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Specific classes</li>
        <li>Research opportunities</li>
        <li>Studying abroad</li>
        <li>Academic rules, regulations, and procedures</li>
        <li>Any topic as it relates to academics at Rice</li>
    </ul>
    </p><br>

    <p>Even if a particular PAA cannot answer each and every detailed question, as fellow students, they can serve as
        familiar and approachable contacts who can point students in the right direction of the proper resources. In
        this way, interactions between academics, learning, and especially advising are ongoing dynamic conversations
        which involve multiple perspectives, not just a prescription for registration.</p>

    <p>Below are the list of Lovett College's PAAs with their contact information, so don't hesitate to ask any of them
        if you need help with your academic plans!</p>
