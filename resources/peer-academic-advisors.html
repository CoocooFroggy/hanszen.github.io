<p>The Peer Academic Advisors (PAAs) consist of your fellow Hanszenites who have been trained by the
    Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to help you choose classes, clarify academic rules and regulations, 
    assist in finding research opportunities and study abroad information, and anything else academically
    related. In addition, the PAAs also facilitate a number of academic events at Hanszen, usually in the 
    form of academic planning sessions, where Hanszenites come together and help each other choose 
    classes for the next term. During O-Week, three Hanszen PAAs will be present to help the incoming
    students narrow their fall courses before their meeting with their divisional advisor. Once the 
    school year starts, about fifteen Hanszen PAAs will be available to answer questions about deadlines, 
    registration, rules, and any other academic questions. Just knock on their doors or send them an email. 
    If they can't find an answer for you, they'll find someone who can. </p> <br> <br>
