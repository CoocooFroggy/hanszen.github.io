                        Description: The SA and RICEngaged are working collaboratively to create a cohort of Civic Engagement Reps at each residential college.
                        Creating a college rep position will help increase civic engagement beyond what we’ve seen at Rice so far. College reps would be a resource
                        that is available on campus, in the serveries, in college group chats—it’s more accessible than any other option currently available.
                        College reps already have existing connections with other people in their college and it's these personal connections that will inspire
                        people to go out and vote.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        College reps would convene with a community of 10 other reps as part of the SA subcommittee on Democratic Engagement. They will support all
                        of their residential college’s different voices. They should believe that every Rice student has a part to play in keeping our democracy healthy
                        and want to promote voting and political awareness on campus. Lastly, they will empower Rice students to become active, engaged citizens capable
                        of mobilizing their communities to create positive social change.
