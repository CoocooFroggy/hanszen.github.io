        <h2>About the H-Team</h2><br>
        <p>The H-Team is what Hanszen calls the dedicated team of adults who live at Hanszen and who provide
            endless wisdom and resources to all Hanszenites. They include the Masters, whose house is by the New Section
            'Burbs, a set of Resident Associates (RAs) in both Old Section and New Section,
            and a College Coordinator housed in the Commons. Their job is to make sure Hanszen is running properly,
            throw excellent study breaks, and serve as mentors and confidants for Hanszenites to support us through the
            highs and lows of college life.
