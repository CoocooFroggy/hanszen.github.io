        <p>We have been married for 38 years and prior to our move to Houston 20 years ago, our careers have 
        taken us to Colorado, New York City, Chicago, and Florida.  We have two sons â€“ Noah, a 2016 graduate of 
        the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, and Reed, a student at Trinity University in San
        Antonio, class of 2020.  Our other family members include Roxanne, our <a href="http://bfy.tw/64p5">Bichon Frise</a> 
        and our two cats, Sabrina and Pat. </p>

        <p>Our role as Masters is to enable Hanszen to self-govern in the most effective ways possible.  In our 
        two years at Hanszen, we have been extremely impressed by the willingness and ability of our students to govern 
        their affairs effectively and with vision.  We work with the other members of the H-Team to encourage participation
        in the Hanszen community to promote activities and new initiatives, administer budgets and other Hanszen resources
        while also adhering to and enforcing Hanszen and Rice University policies.  As Masters, we also seek to promote
        fruitful engagements with Hanszen Associates, and with the larger University and Houston communities. </p>
