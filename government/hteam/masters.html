            <p><i>Jos&eacute; is the co-director for the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics and professor of
                physics and astronomy, chemistry, and biochemistry and cell biology. Mayra is the Program Administrator
                in the Brasil @ Rice program, working in Lovett Hall. She enjoys working to further Rice's goal of
                increased academic exchange with Brazil, and is passionate about helping new Rice students create strong
                academic and social experiences while they're on campus.</i></p>
            <p><i>Their three sons are also settled here in town, and are also part of Houston's diverse academic
                community. Lucas studies at the University of St. Thomas, Diego is a teacher at Kincaid School, and
                Paulo is using his Berkeley degree to do post-baccalaureate research here at Rice.</i></p><br>

            <p>As you can see, we are a truly international family who loves education and learning. We are avid
                travelers who love learning about different cultures and languages. Although we learned and excelled in
                English, both of course our native language is Brazilian Portuguese, and we all speak Spanish as well.
                Mayra particularly enjoys the outdoors, especially after spending 22 years in San Diego. José often
                looks for a good debate about science, politics, sports and current events. We love lively conversation,
                and sometimes José gets loud and animated, but it is just all in fun. We enjoy sports, movies, music and
                good food. Mayra enjoys cooking, and she often finds herself cooking for students, visitors, friends,
                family, and for school events. Her famous home baked Brazilian cheese bread is already becoming a Rice
                tradition!</p>
            <p>We, as the Masters of Lovett College, are here to be your advocates, mentors, advisors and friends. We
                will have the privilege of being beside you, as you grow personally and academically during your years
                at Rice.</p>
