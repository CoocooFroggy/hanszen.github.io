        <p>Angel Marti and Starbucks have one thing in common — coffee. The ground bag of coffee beans in your room
            might have come from his family’s coffee plantation in Utuado, PR, and Angel might have touched them
            prior to the packaging.
            Angel, a native Puerto Rican, was the big brother in his family. Two of his brothers became engineers
            and the other followed Angel’s footsteps as a chemist. Another important person in Angel’s life is his
            7-year old daughter, Kiara. Last Christmas, Angel surprised his daughter by dressing up as a teary-eyed,
            joyful Santa Claus. Angel, who has a bad habit of making corny chemistry jokes, tried to entertain Kiara
            by screaming, “HOH HOH HOH.” She was just too young to understand his humor. Unfortunately, he developed
            this habit during his postdoctoral days as a research scientist at Columbia University. Since Angel came
            to Rice in 2008 as a Professor of Chemistry, he has cut back on his science-related humor. Instead, he
            concentrates most of his energy outside the lab during his free time. He enjoys reading Spanish novels
            and playing racquetball, basketball, and pool. If you couldn’t tell from his excellent posture, Angel
            has a black belt in karate and was on the Puerto Rico Joshinmon Shorin Ryu Olympic team. When he’s not
            playing a sport, he prefers to watch boxing and soccer in addition to his regular TV programming that
            includes How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory. Besides Beer Bike, Angel’s second favorite
            Lovett occasion is O-Week because he is eager to make friendships with new Lovetteers and help with the
            transition to college. You’ll know which is his apartment when you make eye contact with a furry cat
            that’s perched on the window sill. Lucky, Angel’s cat, is infamous for his staring contests at Lovett.
            Don’t hesitate to stop by Angel’s apartment on the 1st floor to make small talk! He is welcoming to
            all... as long as you let him tell you a chemistry joke or two.</p>

        <p>Hey, Lovett! My name is Molly Slattery, and I am one of your second floor RAs! This is my 6th year in the
            position. I just completed my Ph.D. in English at Rice on lesbian feminism, identity politics, and 20th
            century continental philosophy. During the day, I work as an editor and a grant writer in the Office of
            Proposal Development here at Rice. Outside of my academic and work commitments, I have a number of
            hobbies, which include writing poetry, biking, and hiking 250+ mile long trails with Laura and our dog,
            Koda. I am always up for anything, so don’t hesitate to join me in some of my excursions to sporting
            events, gallery openings, or music performances. With a little exploring, you’ll find that Rice and
            Houston have so much to offer!</p>

        <p>I’m Laura Sponaugle, and I am also one of your RAs! Like Molly, this is my 5th year. Lovett is perfect
            and Molly and I are stoked to be here and get to know all of you! Though I am a Houston-native, I’ve
            spent a good portion of my life pursuing my greatest passions, traveling around the world and meeting
            people of all stripes. I’ve lived in both Spain and Mexico and have also spent a great deal of time in
            California, working in a winery in the Napa Valley. However, my love of photography — not to mention my
            love for Texas and my AWESOME family — brought me back to Houston, where my activities are no less
            dynamic.
            Whether training for a marathon, trekking through the back county, traversing the globe, or tackling the
            rigorous demands of my photography business, I welcome the opportunity to challenge myself both
            physically and intellectually. So, if your sense of daring is as keen as mine — or even if you are the
            more introspective type who prefers coffee and conversation— please feel free to seek me out! (Also,
            come say “hello” to our handsome pup, Koda. He is in training but warms up quickly!)</p>
