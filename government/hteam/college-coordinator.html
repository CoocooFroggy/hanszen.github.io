        <p>My name is Sharon O'Leary and I am the Lovett College Coordinator. My office looks out over the Lovett
            Quad where I get to see students coming and going, playing volleyball, hanging out, and doing tricks on
            the trampoline. You will pass by my office on the way to anything important or fun, so stop in and get
            to know me. My office is a great place to start a conversation, ask a question, pick up mail and
            packages, mail a letter, borrow office supplies, staple papers, send a fax, copy something, get
            something notarized, make a cup of tea, eat candy, and on Fridays, pet my grandpuppy Loki. <i>Please</i>
            pay attention to my emails; I often have very important information that yu won't get anywhere else.</p>
        <p>I might not always know <i>everything</i>, but I am a good resource for information and can guide you
            where you need to go for anything you might need at Lovett, Rice, and Houston</p>

        <p>&mdash; Sharon O'Leary, Lovett College Coordinator</p><br>
