        <h2>Joyce Bald</h2><br>
        <p>My name is Joyce and I am the college coordinator. I have been running the college office for over 10 years,
        but have been at Rice for 18 years. Officially, I assist the Masters with the administration of Hanszen. Unofficially,
        I am the daytime RA, mail guru, answerer of questions, and holder of all keys to Hanszen. I am usually in the office 
        M-F from 9am – 5pm, but hours can vary depending on the happenings at Hanszen.</p>
        
        <p>While you are in the Hanszen office you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pick up your packages from home</li>
            <li>borrow a room key (if you are locked out)</li>
            <li>send or receive a fax</li>
            <li>make copies</li>
            <li>buy a stamp </li>
            <li>get a band-aid or an aspirin (or other <a href="../../resources/rice-health-advisors.html">RHA</a> supplies)</li>
            <li>have some tea</li>
            <li>raid the candy jar (everyone’s favorite)</li>
            <li>sleep on the comfy couch (this happens more often than you might think)</li>
            <li>or just take a break and hang out</li>
        </ul>
