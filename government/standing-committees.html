<h2>Standing Committees</h2>
<p>Hanszen's Standing Committees are designated by our Constitution as essential to the functioning of the college, 
and thus are automatically renewed each year. It is because of the hard work of Standing Committees that we have things like
Beer Bike, Associates, Hanszen sports teams, and awesome swag. If you ant to get involved or have any questions/ideas for events,
feel free to find or email the committee heads below!</p>
