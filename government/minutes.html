	<p>Minutes are taken at Preqab and Cab so that everyone who cannot attend can still remain up-to-date on the activity in the college. They also serve as a record of official decisions, and offer transparency in decision making. While Cabinet minutes are printed out every Thursday and placed in the commons for everyone to read, Preqab minutes are found only on the website. <br><br>
