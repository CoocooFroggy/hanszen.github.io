	<p>Minutes are taken at Preqab (pre-Cabinet meeting) and Cabinet so that everyone who cannot attend can still keep up-to-date 
	on college business. They also serve as a record of official decisions, and offer transparency in decision making. 
	While Cabinet minutes are printed out every Thursday and placed in the Lower Commons for everyone to read, Preqab minutes are
	found only on this website. <br><br>
