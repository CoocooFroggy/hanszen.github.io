<h2>Initiative Committees</h2>
<p>Imagine getting Hanszen funding to share your hobbies, interests, and passions with the college-- this is what
Initiative Committees are! This committee system, started in 2014, allows Hannszenites to get involved
doing the things they love most. Initiative committees have included things like arts and crafts, hacking, and brewing.
Check out this year's Initiative Committees below, and feel free to get in touch if you want to get involved.<br>
Otherwise, start thinking of your own ideas for an Initiative Committee (or check out some past Initiatives to bring back) and 
watch for applications in the spring!</p><br>

    <tr><td>Grilling & Outdoor</td>
    <td>The committee puts Hanszen's many grills to good use by providing fine meats on select Fridays <br>
        as well as cooking food for other Hansen outdoor events.</td>
        <td>Nick Fleder<br>Trenton Alexander<br>Josh Morse</td><td>njf2@<br>tja4@<br>jwm4@</td></tr>
    
    <tr><td>Hanszen Brewers</td>
    <td>This is a committee that will provide Hanszen with all of the joy and pleasure that comes with the<br>
         consumption of fine fermented beverages. Using only the highest quality ingredients, we will make <br>
        sure that Hanszen always has a reason to celebrate, and something to drink while they do.</td>
        <td>Max Tolan<br>Jake Silberman</td><td>mct9@<br>wjs4@</td></tr>
    
    <tr><td>HEATS (Hanszen Eats)</td>
    <td>This committee plans (and sometimes subsidizes!) monthly adventures to interesting restaurants around<br>
         Houston, allowing bonding among Hanszenites and exploration of America's most diverse city over good food. </td>
         <td>Liz Myong<br>Kathleen Snider<br>Valerie Du</td><td>eam13@<br>kes14@<br>vxd1@</td></tr>
    
    <tr><td>HHH (Hungry, Hungry Hanszenites)</td>
    <td>The purpose of this committee is to unite Hanszenites in the joy that comes from baking and eating <br>
        freshly baked sweets and treats. Additionally, eating is a great stress reliever, and college students <br>
        are always stressed, so hopefully weâ€™ll be able to relieve some of that! </td>
        <td>Briana Singh<br>Monica Julian<br>Gillian Perkins</td><td>bs42@<br>mj27@<br>glp1@</td></tr>
    
    <tr><td>Rom Com-mittee</td>
    <td>The Rom Com-mittee will bring students together to laugh at themselves and contestants and to fall<br>
         in love with Are You The One/the Bachelor and their fellow Hanszenites. It will be a great time<br>
         for interclass bonding and will provide much-needed study breaks. We genuinely want this committee to<br>
         be a way for a seemingly silly guilty pleasure show to bring some Hanszenites together. </td>

        21st century</td>
