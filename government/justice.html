            <p class="text-justify">The Justice League is a team of seven Hanszenites who form the college's Court as well as having other duties. These include Room Draw, Parking Draw, elections, private event registration, and noise complaints. It's our priority to make our home a safe and fun environment for all Hanszenites. The group is composed of an elected Chief Justice (CJ) and six Associate Justices (AJs). Of these, four are elected Class Justices, and two are appointed Building Justices. Come talk to us if you have any questions or concerns!</p>
            
            <h3 class="light">Day-to-day</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">On a normal day, the Justice League works to make Hanszen a place where everyone is comfortable. The primary way they do this is through private event registration and noise complaints. Private events are registered with the CJ, as it is important that they know what's going on around Hanszen and so that they can respond to matters appropriately.  Noise complaints can be made to the CJ or AJs if you are uncomfortable asking your neighbors to quiet down. The CJ also works with Student Judicial Programs to shape the Rice Alcohol Policy and how the administration handles parties. Keep an eye out on your Rice email for news - the CJ is a listserv regular.</p>
        
            <h3 class="light">Elections</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Most cabinet members are elected in February and serve for a year starting in March. The CJ runs these elections, with help from the Senior Class Justice. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GMOV1Ows8Hyl56LSIV3wPRF2uSfxiI9iPleOg0p4bw0/edit?usp=sharing">Election Code</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 class="light">Room and Parking Draws</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Justice League also decides housing and parking in the spring for the following academic year. The CJ and Senior Class Justice run Room Draw, and the CJ and Junior Class Justice run Parking Draw. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXBDBstLDznHBe1rmmaIjieExtibtFR2Uhooq6x5fek/edit?usp=sharing">Bylaws</a>(pages 7-14 for Room Draw, page 15 for Parking Draw).</p>

            <h3 class="light">Hanszen Court</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Occasionally, rules are broken and property is destroyed. Instead of elevating these issues to the Rice administration or even the H-Team, we have a system for dealing with problems ourselves. We're strong supporters of self-governance, and this is a softer way to learn from mistakes. If a College Court case is opened, the accused can choose either a closed or open hearing, with the Hanszen College Judicial Code governing the proceedings. The College Court can dole our fines and community service hours, depending on the infraction.</p>
        
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>If there is an emergency or another situation that needs immediate attention, first call RUPD or REMS as appropriate.</strong></p>
