                Hey Hanszen! If you're ever having any trouble in any class, want someone 
                to proofread your paper for free, or just want some help with homework/studying for 
                tests, come visit your Hanszen Fellows! The Fellows are a group of friendly Hanszenites who 
                hold review sessions, read papers, and help out with whatever academic needs you may have! We 
                are also going to hold some great lectures, research events, and study breaks this year, so get excited!
				All fellows are available during their office hours listed below, and/or are available by appointment via email!
				They will all also hold review sessions at relevant times throughout the semester.

            <h2>Divisional Advisors</h2>
            <p class="text-justfiy">
                Divisional advisors consist of several Hanszen associates and Rice faculty who graciously 
                volunteer their time to help you choose your classes and answer any questions you might have about certain majors. 
                Most of these advisors specialize in a certain school (School of Engineering, School of Humanities, etc.). 
                During O-Week, you'll have a chance to meet them to go over your planned schedule for the fall, and even 
                during the school year, they will be available (usually by appointment) to help you with class or major 
                decisions. (Note that after you declare a major, you'll be assigned a major advisor, which is an advisor 
                from your department). Make good friends with these wonderful professors! They love to help you find your 
                interests and succeed here at Rice, and are a great resource to have available.

            <h2>Peer Academic Advisors</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The Peer Academic Advisors (PAAs) consist of your fellow Hanszenites who have been trained 
                by the Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to help you choose classes, clarify academic rules and regulations, 
                assist in finding research opportunities and study abroad information, and anything else academically related. 
                In addition, the PAAs also facilitate a number of academic events at Hanszen, usually in the form of academic 
                planning sessions, where Hanszenites come together and help each other choose classes for the next term. 
                During O-Week, four Hanszen PAAs will be present to help the incoming students narrow down which courses 
                they want to take and create their fall schedule. Once the school year starts, about twenty Hanszen PAAs 
                will be available to answer questions about deadlines, registration, rules, and any other academic questions. 
                They really are here to help you, so if you have any questions or just need solid academic advice, feel free 
                to knock on their doors or send them an email. If they can't find an answer for you, they'll find someone who can.
