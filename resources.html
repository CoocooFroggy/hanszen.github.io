                Most of these advisors specialize in a certain school (School of Engineering, School of Humanities, etc.). 
                During O-Week, you'll have a chance to meet them to go over your planned schedule for the fall, and even 
                during the school year, they will be available (usually by appointment) to help you with class or major 
                decisions. (Note that after you declare a major, you'll be assigned a major advisor, which is an advisor 
                from your department). Make good friends with these wonderful professors! They love to help you find your 
                interests and succeed here at Rice, and are a great resource to have available.</p>

                by the Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to help you choose classes, clarify academic rules and regulations, 
                assist in finding research opportunities and study abroad information, and anything else academically related. 
                In addition, the PAAs also facilitate a number of academic events at Hanszen, usually in the form of academic 
                planning sessions, where Hanszenites come together and help each other choose classes for the next term. 
                During O-Week, four Hanszen PAAs will be present to help the incoming students narrow down which courses 
                they want to take and create their fall schedule. Once the school year starts, about twenty Hanszen PAAs 
                will be available to answer questions about deadlines, registration, rules, and any other academic questions. 
                They really are here to help you, so if you have any questions or just need solid academic advice, feel free 
                to knock on their doors or send them an email. If they can't find an answer for you, they'll find someone who can.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">Rice Health Advisors, or RHAs, are students who have been trained on a variety of wellbeing 
                topics. These students work at their college to provide health education opportunities, health supplies and peer 
                guidance. RHAs also act as a liaison between the Student Wellbeing Office and the residential colleges, staying 
                up to date on campus-wide wellbeing programming. It’s important to note that while the RHAs do provide health 
                supplies like bandaids and other first aid supplies, they are mainly here for your mental health and wellbeing. 
                Feel free to contact them or go and talk to them if you need some guidance, need health supplies, or just want 
                to chat! Or meet them at one of the events or study breaks they host throughout the year!</p>
              
              <p class="text-justify">Note: RHAs will direct students to the Wellness Center, Health Services or the Rice Counseling

                <strong>What can the RHAs do for me?</strong><br>
                RHAs are trained on mental health and wellness topics such as being an ALLY, stress relief, suicide prevention, 
                and body acceptance among other topics. They are here if you need to discuss a personal problem or issue in a 
                confidential setting, or if you just want to learn more about the organization.
              </p>

              <p class="text-justify">
                <strong>What health supplies do the RHAs provide?</strong><br>
                Alcohol wipes, Aminofen (Tylenol), antibiotic ointment, antiseptic, Astroglide, Band-Aids, cloth tape, condoms, 
                cough drops, earplugs, elastic bandages, Ibuprofen, hydrocortisone cream, ice packs, sterile gauze pads, tampons, 
                and maybe other supplies. Feel free to ask! RHAs keep a supply kit in their rooms, and there is also an RHA locker 
                in the commons.

              <p class="text-justify">The goals of the STRIVE Liaisons are to raise awareness within the college about the issue 
                of sexual assault and to prepare Hanszenites with the tools they need to become allies and prevent sexual assault 
                in the future. They work with the Title IX office on campus to understand the intricacies of the issue as it pertains 
                to college campuses and Rice in particular. They also serve as confidential resources to listen to Hanszenites and, 
                if requested, connect them to other resources at Rice and/or off campus in Houston that will support them and help 
                them report incidences of sexual assault if they so choose.</p>
