<div class="row">
<strong>Guidelines:</strong> One of Hanszenâ€™s values is inclusivity, which includes financial inclusivity. The goal of the Financial Accessibility program is to provide funds to Hanszen students who want to participate in college events, but who cannot due to their personal financial situation. Money can be requested for (but is not limited to): athletic equipment to participate in college sports, college merchandise, and Hanszen off-campus events. A student cannot request from the fund more than 4 times a semester nor request more than $15 at a time except under extenuating circumstances.<br><br>

Through this program, we hope to reduce any barriers to participation in Hanszen events. Please use the program responsibly and have a Hanszen family heart. HFH!
