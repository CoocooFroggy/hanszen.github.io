                <h3 class="light">Old Section</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">This section is so named because it was the original part of Hanszen before the college was expanded in the late '50s to add "New" Section. Old Section contains a variety of rooms from singles to quads, but it has primarily doubles, with community bathrooms. The first floor is also the home of Alan and Rebecca Russell, two of our Resident Associates. Both the second and third floor boast interior hallways where the majority of old section rooms can be found. If you keep going up to the fourth floor, you'll find a section called the Weenie Loft, which houses both a TV/movie room and a study room. Old section also has a "tower," (part of the building goes up to five stories), with an attached sundeck.</p>

                <h3 class="light">New Section</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">New Section stands across the quad from Old Section, and consists primarily of quad rooms that contain a common room and suite-style bathrooms. Rooms in New Section are generally identified by the stairwell that they are a part of: '40s '50s, '60s, the tower ('70s), '80s, and '90s. At the bottom of the tower, you'll find the Hanszen laundry rooms. Underneath the '50s and '60s is the B&P, which is the Hanszen basement. The '80s and '90s, collectively known as the 'burbs (short for suburbs), have a separate quad with a deck and grills.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Commons Building</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Hanszen Commons consists of the two parts: the lower and upper commons. The Lower Commons is your entrance to the servery, where you can find Joyce's office, and home to a multitude of tables so that you can eat meals, catch up, debate whatever's on your mind, and/or joke with your fellow Hanszenites. It's here that Hanszenites will make announcements about events around the prime meal times. The Lower Commons even has a grand piano for your mealtime serenading desires, or for plinking out "Row Row Row Your Boat" late at night when you think no one's listening.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Upper Commons consists of a large open area with couches and numerous smaller rooms. You'll probably visit the open area at least once a week for Hanszen Cabinet meetings. Also in the Upper Commons a game room with pool and ping pong tables, several nice study rooms, a music room, and Hanszen's own library.</p>

                <p class="lead">All Hanszen rooms come with a twin XL sized bed, a desk and chair, a built-in or standing wardrobe, a dresser, bookshelves, ethernet ports, trash cans, and TV cable jacks.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Doubles</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Old Section Double is what most people imagine when they think of a stereotypical “college room.” Depending on how much stuff the two people inside it have, doubles can range from spacious to cozy, but don’t worry: there is plenty of space for the creative mind.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Quads</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">An Old Section Quad is basically two doubles with a door connecting them. Some Hanszenites choose to put two beds in each room, while others put all four beds in the inner room and treat the outer room as a common space.</p>
                
                <h3 class="light">New Section Quads</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">New Section Quads are two doubles that share a common room. New Section Quads share a bathroom with their neighboring quad.</p>
                
                <h3 class="light">Others</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">There are also singles and triples in the old section and 3-person and 5-person suites in the new section.</p>

                    controllers), a pool table, and a foosball table. It even contains a brand-new poker table and a selection

                    Located in the basement of Hanszen's New Section, the B&P (short for Breadsticks & Pomegranates - it's
                    a long story) boasts brand-new speaker and LED light systems. Able to be reserved by any
                    Hanszenite that puts in a request, it's perfect for parties, concerts by Rice student bands, and any
                    sort of social gathering.

                    panoramic views of the campus and surrounding city and are the ideal spot for Friday evening parties or
                    viewings of the sunset or sunrise.

                    couches and a flatscreen TV, great for movie nights with friends. It's also got an Xbox One complete
                    with Rockband guitars, a drumset, and even a microphone, so be sure to stop by if you want to pretend

                <p class="lead">As much fun as we like to have at Hanszen, we acknowledge that the reason we are at Rice is to learn, so we have a plethora of studying spaces, here ordered from the most isolated to the most social.</p>

                    sure our most social study environment, but also offers a small hangout area with a TV (great for Netflix study breaks!).</p>
