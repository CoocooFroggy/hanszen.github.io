                <p class="text-justify">Hanszen Old Section is so named because it is the oldest part of Hanszen. Built in 1916, the building predates even the founding of Hanszen College. Old Section contains a variety of rooms from singles to quads, but it has primarily doubles, with hall bathrooms. The first floor is also the home of Bryn and Neal Dugre, two of our Resident Associates. Both the second and third floor boast interior hallways where the majority of old section rooms can be found. If you keep going up to the fourth floor, you'll find an area called the Weenie Loft, which houses both a TV/movie room and a study room. Old section also has a five story tower with an attached sundeck.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Sid Richardson</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">For the 2021-2022 school year only, during the construction of New New Section, part of Hanszen lives in Sid Richardson College's old building. The tower is seven split-level stories, each with an upper and a lower floor. Hanszenites occupy the second, fifth, sixth and seventh floors of the building with the third and fourth floors reserved for other colleges. Nick Bourgeois and Lebena Varghese, two of our Resident Associates, live on the second floor, and our Resident Faculty Associates Lam and Rebecca Yu live on the fifth floor.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Commons</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Hanszen Commons consists of two parts: lower commons and upper commons. Lower Commons has the entrance to South Servery, as well as a multitude of tables so that you can eat meals, catch up, debate whatever's on your mind, and/or joke with your fellow Hanszenites. It also includes Joyce's office, a kitchen, and a laundry room. It's here that Hanszenites will make announcements about events during meal times. Lower Commons even has a grand piano for your mealtime serenading desires, or for plinking out "Row Row Row Your Boat" late at night when you think no one's listening.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Upper Commons consists of a large open area with couches and numerous smaller rooms. You'll probably visit the open area at least once a week for Hanszen Cabinet meetings. Also in Upper Commons there is a game room with pool, foosball, and poker tables, several nice study rooms, a music room, a private dining room, and Hanszen's own library.</p>

                <h3 class="light">New New Section (Under Construction)</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Called such to distinguish it from the old "New Section" built in 1957, New New Section will be Hanszen's newest building once it is completed in Summer 2022. New New Section is five stories tall with single and double rooms. Singles share a hall bathroom in groups of 2-3 rooms, and doubles have private bathrooms. The building will host a lobby, two RA suites, three terraces overlooking the quad and patio, and reading nooks on every floor. Built with sustainability in mind, New New Section uses a technique known as mass timber construction. It will be the first building in all of Houston of its kind. The building also incorporates the iconic framed crests and colored tiles from the exterior of the old New Section.</p>

                <h3 class="light">New Section (Recently Deceased)</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The old "New Section" was built in 1957, the same year Hanszen College was founded. Composed entirely of suites, the building was known for its quirky architecture, spacious and fun rooms, and structural problems in its later years. The building hosted a landry room, a sundeck (called the moondeck to avoid confusion with the Old Section sundeck), and the legendary B&P. The B&P (Breadsticks and Pomegranites) was a legendary social space where all sorts of events would occur. Due to said problems, a lack of accessibility, and being an inefficient use of space, New Section was torn down in Summer 2021. Hanszenites have mixed feelings towards their former home. On one hand, the rooms layout was spacious and fun and the B&P was the cultural hub of Hanszen. On the other hand, the rooms and bathrooms were nasty, floods were common, and something just didn't seem right with the builidng.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Double</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Old Section Double is what most people imagine when they think of a stereotypical “college room.” Depending on how much stuff the two people inside it have, doubles can range from spacious to cozy, but don’t worry: there is plenty of space for the creative mind.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Quad</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">An Old Section Quad is basically two doubles with a door connecting them. Some Hanszenites choose to put two beds in each room, while others put all four beds in the inner room and treat the outer room as a common space.</p>

                <h3 class="light">New New Section Double</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">While not as coveted as a single, the New New Section Double is an incredible room in its own right. A spacious room with a private bathroom and lots of storage space.</p>
