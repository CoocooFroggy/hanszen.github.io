                <p class="text-justify">Hanszen Old Section is so named because it was the original part of Hanszen before the college was expanded in the late '50s to add "New" Section. Old Section contains a variety of rooms from singles to quads, but it has primarily doubles, with community bathrooms. The first floor is also the home of Bryn and Neal Dugre, two of our Resident Associates. Both the second and third floor boast interior hallways where the majority of old section rooms can be found. If you keep going up to the fourth floor, you'll find an area called the Weenie Loft, which houses both a TV/movie room and a study room. Old section also has a "tower," (part of the building goes up to five stories), with an attached sundeck.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Sid Richardson</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">For this year only during the construction of our New New Section, part of Hanszen lives in Sid Richardson College's old building. The tower is seven stories, each with an upper and a lower floor. Hanszen itself occupies the second, fifth, sixth and seventh floors of the building with the third and fourth floors reserved for other colleges. Four of our Resident Associates, Lam and Rebecca Yu as well as Nick Bourgeois and Lebena Varghese, live in the building.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Commons Building</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Hanszen Commons consists of the two parts: the lower and upper commons. The Lower Commons is your entrance to South Servery, where you can find a multitude of tables so that you can eat meals, catch up, debate whatever's on your mind, and/or joke with your fellow Hanszenites. It also includes Joyce's office, a kitchen, and a laundry room. It's here that Hanszenites will make announcements about events around the prime meal times. The Lower Commons even has a grand piano for your mealtime serenading desires, or for plinking out "Row Row Row Your Boat" late at night when you think no one's listening.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Upper Commons consists of a large open area with couches and numerous smaller rooms. You'll probably visit the open area at least once a week for Hanszen Cabinet meetings. Also in the Upper Commons a game room with pool, foosball, and poker tables, several nice study rooms, a music room, a private dining room, and Hanszen's own library.</p>
