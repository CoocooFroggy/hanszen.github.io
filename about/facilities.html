                <h3 class="light">Old Section</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">This section is so named because it was the original part of Hanszen before the college was expanded in the late '50s to add "New" Section. Old Section contains a variety of rooms from singles to quads, but it has primarily doubles, with community bathrooms. The first floor is also the home of Bryn and Neal Dugre, two of our Resident Associates. Both the second and third floor boast interior hallways where the majority of old section rooms can be found. If you keep going up to the fourth floor, you'll find a section called the Weenie Loft, which houses both a TV/movie room and a study room. Old section also has a "tower," (part of the building goes up to five stories), with an attached sundeck.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Sid Richardson</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">For this year only during the construction of our New New Section, part of Hanszen lives in Sid Richardson College's old building . The tower is seven stories, each with an upper and a lower floor. Hanszen itself occupies the second, fifth, sixth and seventh floors of the building with the third and fourth floors reserved for other colleges. Two of our Resident Associates, Lam and Rebecca Yu, live in the building.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Commons Building</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Hanszen Commons consists of the two parts: the lower and upper commons. The Lower Commons is your entrance to the servery, where you can find Joyce's office, and home to a multitude of tables so that you can eat meals, catch up, debate whatever's on your mind, and/or joke with your fellow Hanszenites. It's here that Hanszenites will make announcements about events around the prime meal times. The Lower Commons even has a grand piano for your mealtime serenading desires, or for plinking out "Row Row Row Your Boat" late at night when you think no one's listening.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Upper Commons consists of a large open area with couches and numerous smaller rooms. You'll probably visit the open area at least once a week for Hanszen Cabinet meetings. Also in the Upper Commons a game room with pool and ping pong tables, several nice study rooms, a music room, and Hanszen's own library.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Doubles</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Old Section Double is what most people imagine when they think of a stereotypical “college room.” Depending on how much stuff the two people inside it have, doubles can range from spacious to cozy, but don’t worry: there is plenty of space for the creative mind.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Quads</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">An Old Section Quad is basically two doubles with a door connecting them. Some Hanszenites choose to put two beds in each room, while others put all four beds in the inner room and treat the outer room as a common space.</p>
