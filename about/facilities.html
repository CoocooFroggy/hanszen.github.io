                <h3 class="light">Commons</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Hanszen Commons consists of two parts: lower commons and upper commons. Lower Commons has the entrance to South Servery, as well as a multitude of tables so that you can eat meals, catch up, debate whatever's on your mind, and/or joke with your fellow Hanszenites. It also includes Joyce's office, a kitchen, and a laundry room. It's here that Hanszenites will make announcements about events during meal times. Lower Commons even has a grand piano for your mealtime serenading desires, or for plinking out "Row Row Row Your Boat" late at night when you think no one's listening.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Upper Commons consists of a large open area with couches and numerous smaller rooms. You'll probably visit the open area at least once a week for Hanszen Cabinet meetings. Also in Upper Commons there is a game room with pool, foosball, and poker tables, several nice study rooms, a music room, a private dining room, and Hanszen's own library.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Hanszen Old Section is so named because it is the oldest part of Hanszen. Built in 1916 as South Hall, the building predates even the founding of Hanszen College. Old Section contains a variety of room types from singles to quads, but it has primarily doubles. Most residents use communal hall bathrooms, but some rooms have privat The first floor is also the home of Bryn and Neal Dugre, two of our Resident Associates. The second and third floor boast interior hallways where the majority of old section rooms can be found. If you keep going up to the fourth floor, you'll find an area called the Weenie Loft, which houses both a TV/movie room and a study room. Old section also has a five story tower with an attached sundeck.</p>

The tower is seven split-level stories, each with an upper and a lower floor. Most rooms are suites of four students with a private bathroom. Nick Bourgeois and Lebena Varghese, two of our Resident Associates, live on the second floor, and our Resident Faculty Associates Lam and Rebecca Yu live on the fifth floor.</p>

                <h3 class="light">New Section (Under Construction)</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Sometimes called "New New Section" to distinguish it from "Old New Section" built in 1957, New New Section will be Hanszen's newest building once it is completed in 2022. New New Section is 5 stories tall with single and double rooms. Singles share a hall bathroom in groups of 2-3 rooms, and doubles have private bathrooms. The building will host a lobby, two RA suites, three terraces overlooking Hanszen quad, and multiple reading nooks. New New Section's primary structure is made of mass timber, a stronger, lighter, more sustainable option to concrete. It will be the largest mass timber building in Texas when completed. The building also incorporates the iconic framed crests and colored tiles from the exterior of the old New Section that once stood on the same land.</p>

                <h3 class="light">"Old" New Section</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Officially called the "1957 Wing" after the year it was built (the same year Hanszen College was founded), "Old" New Section was the home of Hanszenites for more than 60 years. Composed of suites of 3-5 students, the building was known for its quirky architecture, spacious rooms, and structural problems in its later years. The building hosted a laundry room, a sundeck (called the moondeck to avoid confusion with the Old Section sundeck), and the legendary and sentimental B&P. The B&P (Breadsticks and Pomegranites) was a social space where all sorts of events would occur. Due to said problems, a lack of accessibility, and not having enough beds to house everyone, New Section was torn down in 2021.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The Old Section Double is what most people imagine when they think of a stereotypical “college room.” Depending on how much stuff the two people inside it have, doubles can range from spacious to cozy, but don’t worry: there is plenty of space for the creative mind.</p>

                <h3 class="light">Old Section Quad</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">An Old Section Quad is basically two doubles with a door connecting them. Some Hanszenites choose to put two beds in each room, while others put all four beds in the inner room and treat the outer room as a common space.</p>
