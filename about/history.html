            <p class="text-justify">In 1957 William V. Houston, Rice's second President, initiated the college system, making Hanszen College one 
                    of the four original colleges. The college took the name Hanszen in honor of Harry Clay Hanszen, a member of 
                    the Rice University Board of Governors from 1946-1950, and whose wealth came from his ventures in the oil industry.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Hanszen was once known as the "Gentleman's College," because members, then all-male, were required to wear neckties to dinner. 
                However, by the 1960's most students met this rule by wearing a piece of string around their necks. The tradition was stopped 
                when a student protested by wearing only a necktie to dinner. Hanszen was first on campus (along with Baker College) to open 
                to both genders in 1973. Hanszen males took advantage of the change in the early 1980's to develop the men's drill team, the 
                Hanszenettes, which performed at powderpuff football games. In 1975, tragedy struck Hanszen College when the Commons burned 
                to the ground. It seems a large pile of mattresses, stored in the Commons while Old Section was being renovated, was ignited, 
                possibly by a worker's cigarette. Until a new Commons was built, Hanszen students ate their meals at the Rice Student Center. 
                Hanszenites embraced the change, happily adopting the nickname "The Uncollege," created by other colleges.</p>
                
            <p class="text-justify">Hanszen College has made some fairly important contributions to the development of Rice. For example, Hanszen was the first college 
                to adopt a crest. Hanszen also founded the Rice Coffeehouse in what is now the Weenie Loft. Started in the late 1960's, the "Corner 
                of the Dreaming Monkey" would serve to satiate the Rice community’s cravings for caffeine as well as for a co-ed social spot. 
                Additionally, Rice’s campus-wide radio station, KTRU, started when some students altered the room buzzer system that ran throughout 
                Hanszen into a radio transmission network. The university would eventually recognize the presence of the radio network and reward 
                it with the facilities and equipment that allowed it to become the area-wide station that exists today.</p>
                
            <p class="text-justify">Though long ago Hanszen was known as the "Gentlemen's College" and "The Uncollege," we are now known as the "Family College," a 
                reflection of the close and caring relations among its members. Our current Commons, built in 2002, is a beautiful modern space 
                where you will experience hours of games, fun, and bonding.</p>
