            <h3>"The new institution aspires to university standing of the highest grade ... For the present it is
                proposed to assign no upper limit to its educational endeavor." &mdash;Edgar Odell Lovett</h3><br>

            <p>Edgar Odell Lovett is famously known for being the first president of Rice University (then known as the
                Rice Institute), in addition to being the namesake of the best Residential College at Rice.</p>

            <p>Lovett was born in Ohio in 1871 and received a B.A. from Bethany College and Ph.D.s from the University
                of Virginia and the University of Leipzig. In 1897, Lovett became a professor at Princeton University,
                eventually becoming the head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy. In 1907, Lovett was
                recommended to lead the new Rice Institute by future President of the United States Woodrow Wilson (then
                the President of Princeton University). In 1908, he accepted the offer from the Rice Board of Trustees
                and became the Rice Institute's first president.</p>

            <p>Lovett's visions are still largely continued at Rice today, including being an institute focused both on
                technical skills and liberal arts. Much of Rice's beautiful architecture and spaces was inspired by
                Lovett's travels to prestigious universities while developing what Rice was to be. Lovett's legacy lives
                on over 100 years after Rice was founded, and in honor of his contributions, during the centennial
                celebration in 2012, a statue of Edgar Odell Lovett was added to the Rice campus.</p>
