            <h3 class="light">What the heck is Beer Bike?</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Beer Bike is one of the events Hanszenites look forward to the most! Run by RPC (Rice Program Council), Beer Bike is a relay race in which participants alternate biking around a track and chugging water as fast as they can.
                The week leading up to Beer Bike is called Beer Bike Week, and there are events happening almost 24/7. It's very chaotic but oh so much fun. This year, Hanszen women seek to defend their 1st place overall finish from 2022,
                and the men, who won in 2021, are hungry to get back to the top. Both teams have exceptional promise, and will be very fun to watch this year.
            </p>

            <h3 class="light">History</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The Hanszen Beer Bike Teams have a long and successful history. From competing in the very first Beer Bike in 1957, to countless victories since, to the Hanszenettes (Rice's first all-male cheerleading team!), we have always held Beer Bike in a special place at Hanszen.
                In the very first Beer Bike in 1957, the race was done around the inner loop. One Hanszen biker really wanted to win and took a pretty egregious shortcut, tragically disqualifying the team. While we do not condone cheating in any way, we do commend them on their ingenuity and out-of-the-box thinking.
            </p>

            <h3 class="light">How do I Participate?</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Beer Bike is usually held in early April, and we are already planning out activities for the entire Beer Bike Week!
                The Beer Bike Coordinators, Bike Captains, Chug Captains, and Guardians work for months
                to bring Hanszen the best possible Beer Bike Week. They are in charge of putting together a team for race day,
                throwing fun events during Beer Bike Week and pulling jacks (friendly pranks) on other colleges.
                Reach out to any of these people if you want to be on a team or have ideas for events or jacks!
