        <h2>Study Spaces</h2> <br>

        <p>As much fun as we like to have at Hanszen, we acknowledge that the reason we are at Rice is to learn, so we have a plethora of
            studying spaces, here ordered from the most isolated to the most social.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Weenie Loft—Located in the 4th floor of Old Section, Hanszen’s eclectic attic has tables, couches, and chalk board walls
                that are sure to help you work hard</li>

            <li>Old Section Study Room—Located in the second floor of Old Section, this study room is the perfect place to get away
                from the bustle of the Commons and study</li>

            <li>Computer Room—Also in the Upper Commons, our computer room contains state-of-the art PC and Mac computers,
                as well as a Rice printer (6 cents per page) </li>

            <li> Library—Located in the Upper Commons, Hanszen’s recently renovated library has books galore and ample natural lighting</li>

            <li>Upper Commons—Hanszen’s Upper Commons has couches and tables, as well as 3 classrooms, which are great for
                studying in groups </li>

            <li>Lower Commons—Hanszen’s dining room is always full of people doing problem sets or cramming for exams, and is Hanszen’s
                most social study environment </li>
        </ol>
