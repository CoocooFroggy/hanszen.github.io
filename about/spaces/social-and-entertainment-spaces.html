        <p>Hanszen loves hanging out and having a great time, and our spaces reflect that. Here are some of our most fun areas:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>B&P (Breadsticks and Pomegranates)—This room in the New Section basement is a hot spot for parties, concerts, and
                social gatherings of all sorts.</li>

            <li>Sundecks—Two sundecks, on the 5th floors of New Section and Old Section, offer a great view of the campus and the
                surrounding city, and are increasingly a hub for social activities at Hanszen</li>

            <li>Movie Room—In the 4th floor of Old Section, Hanszen’s recently renovated movie room has reclining couches, great for
                napping, as well as a giant TV and a WiiU</li>

            <li>Music Room—Hanszen’s new Upper Commons music room is the place to be for practicing the piano or rehearsing with your band</li>

            <li>Kitchen—Hanszen has a kitchen in the Lower Commons, perfect for baking late night cookies or dinner on Saturday Nights</li>
        </ol>
