        <h3>Old Section Doubles</h3>
        <p>The Old Section Double is what most people imagine when they think of a stereotypical “college room.” Depending on how
            much stuff the two people inside it have, doubles can range from spacious to cozy, but don’t worry: there is plenty of
            space for the creative mind.</p><br>

        <h3>Old Section Quads</h3>
        <p>An Old Section Quad is basically two doubles with a door connecting them. Some Hanszenites choose to put two beds
            in each room, while others put all four beds in the inner room and treat the outer room as a common space.</p><br>

        <h3>New Section Quads</h3>
        <p> New Section Quads are two doubles that share a common room. New Section Quads share a bathroom with their neighboring quad.</p><br>

        <p>**Hanszen also has singles, triples, and two 5-person suites, but these are more rare than the above room types**</p>
