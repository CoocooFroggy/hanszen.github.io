        <h3 align="center">The Guardian</h3>
        <p> The Guardian is the protector of Hanszen College. After a Willy Week jack in which 
            the Hanszen swing was stolen, a Hanszenite welded the metal knight to forever guard 
            the swing. So today in the Hanszen quad stands The Guardian â€“ fiercly defending all 
            things Hanszen.

        <h3 align="center">Hanszen Heart</h3>
        <p> Hanszen Heart is what makes us the Family College. It's being there for your fellow Hanszenites,
            whether it's supporting each other at games and concerts or picking each other up when we're down.
            It's always looking out for each other; always having each others' backs. It's giving back to those 
            in need, through our "Bleeding Hearts" and Service committees or other ventures in our community. 
            It's the caring that makes us a true family.

        <h3 align="center">Mardi Gras</h3>
        <p> Hanszen's biggest public party is Mardi Gras. Strangely, this party used to 
            be held in the fall semester, until it was moved to March to coincide with the New
            Orleans celebration. Complete with beads, beignets, lights, and a midnight dance contest,
            Hanszen transforms into New Orleans for the night.

        <h3 align="center">Crane Day</h3>
        <p> Started on February 15, 2001, Crane Day is one of the newer traditions around Hanszen. 
            During the construction of new Wiess, one of the cranes became unstable and perilously 
            loomed over Hanszen New Section. All of the students immediately evacuated, but rather 
            than going to class, they brought out a keg and decided to throw a party. Hanszenites 
            uphold this tradition with an all-day celebration.

        <h3 align="center">Float the Keg</h3>
        <p> If you walk into the Hanszen Upper Commons during the last Cabinet meeting before Changeover in the Spring,
            you'll be surprised to hear delightful screams and keg. Every year, Hanszen sets aside money to fund
            Hanszenite's most extravagant ideas. Hanszenites pitch their ideas to the whole college, and the winners 
            of a popular vote are funded. Float the Keg has funded things like our trampoline, hundreds of cake pops, 
            and even camel rides for the whole college.

        <h3 align="center">Other Traditions</h3>
        <p> There is simply not enough room on this website to describe all of our awesome events Hanszen throws every year! 
            Hanszen also does events like Galveston trips, ice skating, light saber battles, Deathball (commons dodgeball), 
            Mr. Hanszen (a male pageant), concerts, and college nights.</p> 
         <p>  
            Hanszen also loves funding new events, and these can be creat   ed by <em>anyone</em>! Hanszen has an Activities Fund,
            so any Hanszenite with an event idea can get money from Cabinet to throw study breaks and events for the college.

<h2>Jacks and Rivalries</h2>
<hr>
<div class="row" align="left"> 
    <p> As great as Hanszen is, everything has its drawbacks. Hanszen's is its eyesore of a neighbor, Wiess College. 
        To begin, they can't even spell their own name right (it's Weiss!). Their building looks like a prison,
        their cult-like traditions are simply weird, and their mustard-looking color, which they wrongly identify as Goldenrod,
        is vomit-inducing.
        </p>
    
    <p> Our rivary with Wiess extends to our cheers, jacks, and even college sports. For example, since Wiess's mascot is the pig,
        each year when we play Wiess at Powderpuff, we devour a full roasted pig and bacon on the sidelines as we cheer on our women. 
        While our rivalry is (mostly) facetious,  conside yourself lucky to be a member of the objectively better college of the two. Below are some of the ways we like to celebrate our rivalry:

        <h3>Jailbreak </h3>
        <p> During O-Week and Willy Week, benevolent Hanszen liberates Wiessmen from the prison that
            is their own existance with a jack we call Jailbreak. Late at night, we blast Hanson's "Mmmbop" 
            in the Wiess quad and loudly knock on all their doors while they futilely attempt to retaliate with water balloons. </p>

        <h3>Wiess Wall</h3>
        <p> On a normal day, Wiessmen reach the academic quad by crossing through the Hanszen quad through a passageway
            near the Hanszen Commons. During Willy Week, Hanszen prevents Wiessmen from trespassing onto our property 
            by erecting a wall in this passageway so that Wiessman have to take a much longer route to class. Then, we
            sit in the commons and watch confused Wiessmen try to get by, sometimes getting splashed in the face by an 
            automatic sprinkler.
