        <h3 align="center">The Guardian</h3>
        <p> The Guardian is the protector of Hanszen College. After a Willy Week jack in which 
            the Hanszen swing was stolen, a Hanszenite welded the metal knight to forever guard 
            the swing. So today in the Hanszen quad stands The Guardian – fiercly defending all 
            things Hanszen.

        <h3 align="center">Hanszen Heart</h3>
        <p> Hanszen Heart is what makes us the Family College. It's being there for your fellow Hanszenites,
        whether it's supporting each other at games and concerts or picking each other up when we're down.
        It's always looking out for each other; always having each others' backs. It's giving back to those 
        in need, through our "Bleeding Hearts" and Service committees or other ventures in our community. 
        It's the caring that makes us a true family.</p>

        <h3 align="center">Mardi Gras</h3>
        <p> Hanszen's biggest public party is Mardi Gras. Strangely, this party used to 
            be held in the fall semester, until it was moved to March to coincide with the New
            Orleans celebration. Complete with beads, beignets, lights, and a midnight dance contest,
            Hanszen transforms into New Orleans for the night.

        <h3 align="center">Crane Day</h3>
        <p> Started on February 15, 2001, Crane Day is one of the newer traditions around Hanszen. 
            During the construction of new Wiess, one of the cranes became unstable and perilously 
            loomed over Hanszen New Section. All of the students immediately evacuated, but rather 
            than going to class, they brought out a keg and decided to throw a party. Hanszenites 
            uphold this tradition with an all-day celebration.

        <h3 align="center">Float the Keg</h3>
        <p> If you walk into the Hanszen Upper Commons during the last Cabinet meeting before Changeover in the Spring,
            you'll be surprised to hear delightful screams and keg. Every year, Hanszen sets aside money to fund
            Hanszenite's most extravagant ideas. Hanszenites pitch their ideas to the whole college, and the winners 
            of a popular vote are funded. Float the Keg has funded things like our trampoline, hundreds of cake pops, 
            and even camel rides for the whole college.

        <h3 align="center">Other Traditions</h3>
        <p> There is simply not enough room on this website to describe all of our awesome events Hanszen throws every year! 
            Hanszen also does events like Galveston trips, ice skating, light saber battles, Deathball (commons dodgeball), 
            Mr. Hanszen (a male pageant), concerts, and college nights.</p> 
         <p>  
            Hanszen also loves funding new events, and these can be creat   ed by <em>anyone</em>! Hanszen has an Activities Fund,
            so any Hanszenite with an event idea can get money from Cabinet to throw study breaks and events for the college.

        <h3>Will Rice</h3>
        <p>Lovett has a rivalry

            of a very different kind with

            Will Rice. The main difference

            between our two colleges is

            how we carry ourselves. Will

            Rice may seem too competitive

            at times with its very singular

            focus on athletics. At Lovett,

            we are a bit more relaxed.

            Although we also do VERY well

            on and off the field (Lovett has

            won the President’s Cup the

            last THREE CONSECUTIVE

            YEARS), we value having fun

            above all else, and realize that

            winning isn’t everything&mdash;something that Will Ricers seem to

            lose sight of.</p>

<h2>Other Traditions</h2>
<hr>
<div class="row" align="center">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>EOL Day</h3>
        <p>Late in April, Lovett College celebrates the

            birthday of Edgar Odell Lovett, its namesake and

            Rice’s irst president with an all- day outdoor festival. Join your fellow Lovetteers in celebrating

            another year well-spent at Lovett with tie-dye

            and spray-paint, giant inlatable slip and slides,

            and music and dancing in the lovely Houston sun,

            while preparing a delicious feast of crawish for

            the entire college.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Musicale</h3>
        <p>The spring talent show takes Lovetteers

            down to “Lyle’s,” the large, theatre-type venue in

            the Lovett Basement to be witnesses to the tal-
            ents and antics of our classmates. Previous acts

            have included 90's Guilty Pleasure Karaoke, cho-
            reographed gymnastics and stand up comedy. Mu-
            sicale draws a large and heavily engaged crowd and

            ends with the Lovett seniors taking the stage to

            serenade the peers whom they’re departing with

            a little song written a long, long time ago. Musicale

            memories last forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Second Floor Sundeck</h3>
        <p>Located on Lovett’s second loor next to the

            staircase is a fabulous sundeck. Outfitted with reclining chairs and a table, the

            Sundeck is a great place to relax, tan, or

            socialize. Lovett events like the Graduation Party and college nights

            happen on the Sundeck! The sundeck’s

            location is also a bonus&mdash;located right

            next to second loor. Lovett’s second

            floor is home to some of the friendliest students at the college. They often

            prop their doors open and welcome

            impromptu company!</p>

        <h3>Commons Culture</h3>
        <p>One of the most unique aspects

            of Lovett College is our amazing community of “the Commons,” which are always a

            hub activity. During every meal, the Upper Commons is full of Loveteers hungry for food and

            socialization, and even during the wee hours of

            the night, at least one Lovetteer is bound to be

            awake and “studying”. Lower Commons includes game tables, couches with a TV area, and off

            campus lockers. Loveteers who spend a lot of

            time in the Commons (and we mean A LOT -

            it’s not uncommon to see a few people sleeping)

            are known as "Commoners". Twice a year, Lovett

            celebrates our Commons with the Middle Commons Ball, in which we hold an awesome dance

            party on the middle step connecting the Lower

            and Upper Commons.</p>

        <h3>Cobb Wall</h3>
        <p>Back in the day food was

            shipped in from a central cam-
            pus kitchen and freshmen were

            made to serve upperclassmen

            dinner before eating themselves.

            The infamous “Cobb” was the

            Lovett maître d’ and not well

            liked at all. A particularly rebellious Lovett freshman whose

            name has been forever lost to

            memory immortalized Cobb

            by writing “Cobb Sucks” on the

            commons bathroom wall. Housing and Dining painted over the

            wall, and it was rewritten. Over

            the years H&amp;D has attempted to cover the message, and still

            Lovetteers

            have responded by reafirming how much Cobb still sucks.</p>
