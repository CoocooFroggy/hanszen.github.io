            <p>Lovett proudly hosts the one of the first (college) public

                parties of the fall semester! It is a privilege we’ve

                earned and held for DECADES. The main focus

                of the party is to introduce the new students to

                the high level at which we throw themed parties

                on Rice campus. The party’s theme is announced

                weeks before the party is held in the Lovett commons. So get with your friends, come up with cool

                costumes, and show Rice that Lovett knows how

                to party!</p>

            <h2 align="center">Casino Party</h2>
            <p>Lovett’s Casino Party is a

                classy soirée, and the best

                party of the spring semester,

                during which the entire campus descends on a fully decked

                out Lovett quad and commons

                for a night of casino games,

                themed activities, and a great

                time. The themed facade in the

                quad is built entirely by Lovetteers (a great way to earn

                freshman service hours) and

                in past years facades have included a James Bond city, light

                designs using Lovett’s grating,

                and the Playboy Mansion (re-
                plete with Bunnies).</p>

            <h2>Sid Rich</h2>
            <p>The Sid Colony casts an ominous specter over

                the shining visage of Lovett College. Sid Richardson

                Colony was built two years after Lovett, in OUR

                PARKING LOT. So, logically, Lovett claimed the new

                building as its rightful colony. During certain times of

                the year (O-Week, Beer Bike, Finals) the Sid Colonists become quite rebellious and must be put in

                their rightful place! Lovett crusades valiantly to restore order to the land that was once rightfully
                ours.

                Such is our rivalry with Sid.</p>

            <h2>Will Rice</h2>
            <p>Lovett has a rivalry

                of a very different kind with

                Will Rice. The main difference

                between our two colleges is

                how we carry ourselves. Will

                Rice may seem too competitive

                at times with its very singular

                focus on athletics. At Lovett,

                we are a bit more relaxed.

                Although we also do VERY well

                on and off the field (Lovett has

                won the President’s Cup the

                last THREE CONSECUTIVE

                YEARS), we value having fun

                above all else, and realize that

                winning isn’t everything&mdash;something that Will Ricers seem to

                lose sight of.</p>

            <h2>EOL Day</h2>
            <p>Late in April, Lovett College celebrates the

                birthday of Edgar Odell Lovett, its namesake and

                Rice’s irst president with an all- day outdoor festival. Join your fellow Lovetteers in celebrating

                another year well-spent at Lovett with tie-dye

                and spray-paint, giant inlatable slip and slides,

                and music and dancing in the lovely Houston sun,

                while preparing a delicious feast of crawish for

                the entire college.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2>Musicale</h2>
            <p>The spring talent show takes Lovetteers

                down to “Lyle’s,” the large, theatre-type venue in

                the Lovett Basement to be witnesses to the tal-
                ents and antics of our classmates. Previous acts

                have included 90's Guilty Pleasure Karaoke, cho-
                reographed gymnastics and stand up comedy. Mu-
                sicale draws a large and heavily engaged crowd and

                ends with the Lovett seniors taking the stage to

                serenade the peers whom they’re departing with

                a little song written a long, long time ago. Musicale

                memories last forever.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2>Second Floor Sundeck</h2>
            <p>Located on Lovett’s second loor next to the

                staircase is a fabulous sundeck. Outfitted with reclining chairs and a table, the

                Sundeck is a great place to relax, tan, or

                socialize. Lovett events like the Graduation Party and college nights

                happen on the Sundeck! The sundeck’s

                location is also a bonus&mdash;located right

                next to second loor. Lovett’s second

                floor is home to some of the friendliest students at the college. They often

                prop their doors open and welcome

                impromptu company!</p>

            <h2>Commons Culture</h2>
            <p>One of the most unique aspects

                of Lovett College is our amazing community of “the Commons,” which are always a

                hub activity. During every meal, the Upper Commons is full of Loveteers hungry for food and

                socialization, and even during the wee hours of

                the night, at least one Lovetteer is bound to be

                awake and “studying”. Lower Commons includes game tables, couches with a TV area, and off

                campus lockers. Loveteers who spend a lot of

                time in the Commons (and we mean A LOT -

                it’s not uncommon to see a few people sleeping)

                are known as "Commoners". Twice a year, Lovett

                celebrates our Commons with the Middle Commons Ball, in which we hold an awesome dance

                party on the middle step connecting the Lower

                and Upper Commons.</p>

            <h2>Cobb Wall</h2>
            <p>Back in the day food was

                shipped in from a central cam-
                pus kitchen and freshmen were

                made to serve upperclassmen

                dinner before eating themselves.

                The infamous “Cobb” was the

                Lovett maître d’ and not well

                liked at all. A particularly rebellious Lovett freshman whose

                name has been forever lost to

                memory immortalized Cobb

                by writing “Cobb Sucks” on the

                commons bathroom wall. Housing and Dining painted over the

                wall, and it was rewritten. Over

                the years H&amp;D has attempted to cover the message, and still

                Lovetteers

                have responded by reafirming how much Cobb still sucks.</p>
