                    Welcome, new Hanszenites! My name is Alan and I serve as Hanszen's Chief Justice. Officially, my job is to enforce the college judicial code, lead Hanszen's <a href="/government/justice.html">Justice League</a>, and serve as an intermediary between Hanszenites and other college/campus-wide officials. Although my job description includes enforcing rules, I am not here to police you. The Chief Justice position exists to help everyone understand the expectations of both our college and the university and to keep all students safe. I will discuss with all of you what the rules look like and how to protect yourself. I am also a resource if you feel at all unsafe, need someone to quiet down, or just need someone to vent to. My goal is to make sure you are comfortable at Hanszen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also happen to be one of Hanszen's website managers, and I have put together the O-Week section of the website just for you. I'm always looking for input and feedback from everyone, so please <a href="https://forms.gle/s3uBvRxzFZyBDaVQ8" target="_blank">let me know</a> if you have any questions or recommendations!
