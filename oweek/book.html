        Our O-Week Coordinators have worked hard this summer to prepare the 2023 O-Week Book for you all!
        If you're looking for what to bring, what to expect, what the heck Hanszen is, or just want to read up about your advisors, this is the place to look!
        The book is your one-stop-shop guide to all things O-Week!
