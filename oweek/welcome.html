            Hello Future Hanszenite!!!
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
            As the Hanszen O-Week Coordinators, we are beyond thrilled to be among the first to welcome you to
            Rice. Congrats on surviving high school! We want to commend you on both your past accomplishments
            and future achievements you will undoubtedly reach during your time here. Our names our Q, Emily, and
            Sanjana, otherwise known as Team QuESo. We are current undergraduates (Em and Sanj are rising
            juniors, Q’s a rising senior), and we were chosen to organize an immersive and unforgettable orientation
            experience for the matriculating class of 2023 (aka, you guys)!
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
            While your orientation may only be a week, at Rice we like to say that “O-Week lasts forever,”
            because it really does. During these next few years, you are going to build an amazing community of
            peers and faculty members that will support and guide you throughout your time at Rice, and our job
            during O-Week is to help foster the beginnings of that community to help you transition both academically
            and socially to life at our university. You’ll find that Rice has an abundance of resources to guide you,
            and, with that, an abundance of information, which can be a bit overwhelming. To help you navigate some
            of these resources, we have made this book to help you better understand what life is like as a Rice
            undergrad. Think of this as a little study guide on Rice University, complete with fun facts and pretty
            pictures! We’ve tried to highlight all the essentials you’ll need to start off the year with a bang, so whether
            you read this book cover to cover, or, again, just flip to the pretty pictures, we hope it gets you hyped for
            the Rice experience. Feel free to reference this handy guide beyond O-Week, as we’ve also provided lists
            of our favorite classes, Rice study spots, and places to explore in Houston! We should also mention,
            while every New Student receives a campus-wide Rice book, only new Hanszenites receive this
            exclusive, special Zen edition copy. Wow!
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
            Now, on behalf of all of Hanszen, we want to formally welcome you to the family, and an amazing
            one at that. Here at Zen, we take a lot of pride in our “Hanszen Family Heart,” and we are so excited to
            welcome you into a community that thrives on its members’ spirit, inclusivity, and mutual support. With
            these values in mind, we have made Hanszen Orientation Week’s theme, NachO-Week: Unlimited
            Toppings, Unlimited Possibilities! In our eyes, as weird as it may sound, we see each of you starting
            college off with a fresh plate of nachos. Throughout your time at Rice, you will have numerous
            opportunities to accent it with various toppings a.k.a. experiences that will serve to help you create your
            own culinary college journey. Likewise, we are so excited to see the unique traits and passions you bring
            to Hanszen College and the ways in which you will shape our college’s culture in the coming years and
            beyond. Now, before you get too excited, we highly recommend you take advantages of the many
            resources available to help familiarize yourself with your future family college. A great way to do that is by
            visiting the Hanszen College website (hanszen.rice.edu) and looking through different tabs, the “O-Week”
            one in particular, which provide various info on our history, traditions, and important members like our H-Team 
            who you’ll meet during orientation. If you want to reach out or have questions about anything at all,
            please feel free to contact us at hanszenoweek2019@gmail.com (seriously, we’re here all summer,
            please hit us up).
