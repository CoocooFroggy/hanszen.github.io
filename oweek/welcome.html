                Hello, future Hanszenites!!!
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Welcome to your Home away from Home! We are your 2022 O-Week Coordinators: Sarah Eunsu Kim, Arvind Ramesh, and Marc Armeña, aka Team inStAgraM. Firstly, we would like to say from the bottom of our hearts: congratulations on your acceptance to Rice University and your placement into Hanszen College, the best college ever! For the past seven months (and counting), we have been tirelessly planning your first exhilarating week at Rice.
            </p>

                During O-Week and your time here, you will build strong connections and communities with peers, faculty, and staff that will support and guide you. But what exactly is O-Week? In short, O-Week, or Orientation Week, aims to introduce you to the college experience, and our job is to help you successfully transition to college life both academically and socially while building those communities of support. During this week, you will learn about Rice’s academics, immerse yourself in Hanszen’s culture and community, and discover countless opportunities that Rice offers. We made this book to guide you through that first week and beyond, along with introductions to our O-Week team, information about what to pack, what to expect when you arrive at Hanszen, fun facts about our history and traditions, and much more!
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                On behalf of all of Hanszen, we want to formally welcome you to the family. Here at Zen, we take a lot of pride in our “Hanszen Family Heart” or “HFH'' for short. Our family thrives on its members’ unique spirit, strong sense of inclusivity, and our commitment to mutual support — all values that embody HFH. With these principles in mind, we chose the theme for Hanszen’s 2022 Orientation Week to be PhotO-Week: Where the Reel Magic Awaits! Just as a photo says a thousand words, students coming from all over the world have their own stories and experiences, and we are excited for you to share this with our community and shape our culture in the coming years and beyond. Our goal for O-Week is to introduce you to Hanszen, Rice, and the culture that we feel truly makes it a family. However and wherever on campus you want to contribute, we hope this week will give you the confidence and resources to find your home and develop long-lasting memories.

                As you’ll be able to tell after reading this, all of us here at Hanszen can’t wait for you to arrive. Are we a bit strange? Probably. Overzealous? Yeah. Committed to helping you have the most comfortable adjustment to Rice as possible? Definitely. So, if there is ever anything we can do for you, contact us! Welcome to Hanszen and get ready for the next best years of your life! See you soon!
