                Welcome Home, New Hanzenites!!
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                First, we would like to say congratulations and welcome to Rice, and to Hanszen- the best residential college there is! We are your O-Week Coordinators: Bianca, Amber, and Kourtney, otherwise known as Team BirthdAy caKe. We were chosen to plan an exciting, immersive, and unforgettable O-Week to kick off your time at Rice! 
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                While your official orientation may only last a week, we like to say that “O-Week lasts forever,” because it really does. During your time here, you’ll build an amazing community of peers, faculty members, and staff that will help guide and support you. Our goal for O-Week is to help you foster the beginnings of that community as you transition both academically and socially to life at Rice. You’ll find that Rice has an abundance of resources and information that can help you in a variety of areas. We put together the O-Week book to help introduce you to these resources, your first week, and beyond. In it, you’ll find information about the GelatO-Week team, what to expect when you arrive at Hanszen, quirky fun facts, and so much more.

                On behalf of Hanszen, we wish to formally welcome you into our family. Here at Zen, we take a lot of pride in our “Hanszen Family Heart,” or HFH as we like to call it. Our family thrives on its members' unique spirit, personalities, and perspectives. With these values in mind, we chose Hanszen’s Orientation Week theme, GelatO-Week: Find Your Flavor. We want to encourage our New Students to explore all of the diverse opportunities ahead of them and find what flavors work for them. We hope that this week will give you the confidence and resources to begin finding your flavor. Additionally, we cannot wait to see how your unique passions and traits help shape the culture of Hanszen College in the coming years and beyond.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                We are so excited to meet y’all in August. In the meantime, we encourage you to take advantage of the many resources we have to help familiarize yourself with your new family college. Beyond reading the book, feel free to visit the Hanszen College website (hanszen.rice.edu) and look through the different tabs, which contain a bunch of information about O-Week, Hanszen history, traditions, and people. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:gelatoweek@gmail.com">gelatoweek@gmail.com</a> (seriously, we’re here to answer any and all questions!).
