		<p>Are you ready? You’d better be ready, because this is the first day of a new, exciting, Hanszen-filled part of your life. 
		You’ve got a great week ahead of you, and here are some helpful bits of information to know before you come on move-in day:</p>
		
		<p>Arrival times are between 9 am and 11 am on August 14th. If you have any trouble finding Hanszen, don’t hesitate to ask for help! 
		You’ll know once you make it to Hanszen. You’ll hear a bunch of people shouting your name and running towards your car. 
		These are your Advisors, Co-advisors, and Affiliates, who will be with you for the entire week! Your Advisors, along with members of 
		Rice’s football team, will take care of getting all of your stuff, your bags, and your clothes to your room. 
		We’ll take you inside our Commons, and there you’ll get to meet our O-Week Coordinators, our Masters and RAs, 
		and our Hanszen President and Chief Justice. Once hands have been shaken, names exchanged, and room keys given,
		you’ll want to strike a pose for your first picture as a Hanszenite! 
		
		<p>	Once all that’s done, we’ll take you up to your room where you can unpack your things and get to know your roommate. 
		Take some time to settle in and check to see if you have everything you need. Even if you don’t, the Gophers or your 
		Advisors will be able to help you out in getting anything you’re missing. Next, we’ll have lunch! South Servery will 
		prepare a great meal for you and your family. Enjoy it and spend some time with your parents. Don’t be afraid to sit 
		with strangers because you’ll be meeting new people all week! After lunch you’ll say goodbye to your parents. 
		Say your real goodbyes before you get to campus – it might be overwhelming once you get here,
		however take all the time you need. Remember that your parents are only a phone call away so don’t forget to 
		call them now and again. You’re about to have a busy, fun-filled week, and we promise that it’ll be well worth
		it! Welcome to Rice. Welcome to Hanszen.</p>
		
		<p>Welcome to O-Week!</p>
