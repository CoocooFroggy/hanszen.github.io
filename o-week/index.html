        <h2>About O-Week</h2><br>
        <p>CONGRATULATIONS! If you’re reading this, it can only mean one thing: you are now a part of Hanszen College! We’re aware that it might not mean much to you right now to be a Hanszenite, but just wait! Before you know it, you’ll be swept up into Hanszen's warm embrace and you will see firsthand why we are all so proud to call Hanszen our home. As your O-Week Coordinators, we’ve been hard at work for months getting ready to welcome you to Hanszen and to Rice University.
		
		Your O-Week will be many things, including both an introduction to academic life at Rice and to the residential college system. But, like generations of Hanszenites before you, we hope that your O-Week will be deined by those countless in-between moments: late-night food runs, funny conversations as you walk from place to place, and spontaneous shenanigans. These will form the basis of new friendships and community that will last throughout your Rice career and, hopefully, for the rest of your life! Both during and after O-Week, your Advisors, Co-Advisors, and Afiliates will be your trusted resources and first new friends, and they will teach you everything you need to know about academics, social life, and how to thrive as a successful Rice Owl and Hanszenite.

		We, your Coordinators, are also always available to answer any questions you have, as is every member of our amazing adult support staff! Hanszen College has been around for almost 60 years, and over that time, innumerable stories and traditions have sprung up that form the basis of our college’s spirit and identity. Hanszen prides itself on its inclusivity, an aspect of our culture that we hope you will take full advantage of by breaking out of your comfort zone, knowing that Hanszen will always have your back. We hope that Hanszen spirit captures you just as it has us, as there’s truly nowhere else in the world we’d rather call home. This is an exciting time of transition for each and every new student, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to be the ones to help you make that jump into Rice and into Hanszen!
