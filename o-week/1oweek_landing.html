  	<p>Dear new Hanszenite,</p><br>
	<p>Welcome to Hanszen!</p> <br>
	<p>We are SO excited that you are a part of the Hanszen family! For this year, Hanszen Orientation Week 
	(or O-Week as we like to call it) has the theme of Hollywood StudiO-Week! We chose this theme because even 
	though Hanszen has always prided itself on being the Family College, we want to emphasize the uniqueness and
	individuality of each of its newest members. We are in awe of all of your accomplishments up to this point,
	and we can’t wait for you to shine in your next big role as the newest member of Hanszen College! 
	Before you begin taking classes, we want to make sure you have the chance to familiarize yourself with 
	ice and our wonderful college. We hope you will spend time clicking through our website, so you
	can gain some insight into our college, its culture, and an introduction to some of the first people 
	you’ll meet during O-Week. You likely have a lot of questions about college life and what to expect,
	so please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Contact <a href="mailto:hanszenoweek2016@gmail.com">hanszenoweek2016@gmail.com</a> if
	you have any questions or just want to say hi! You really lucked out by being assigned 
	to Hanszen College, and we’re so proud to be a part of O-Week to welcome you into Rice with open arms. </p> 
	<p>We cannot wait to see you August 14th; Get ready for the greatest week of your life.	</p>
	<br>
	<p>With a Hanszen Heart,</p>
	<p>Serena Brandler <br> Lauren Heller <br> Amber Song</p>
