  	<p>Dear New Hanszenite,<br><br>
	Welcome to Hanszen! <br><br>
We are extremely excited that you are a part of the Hanszen family! For this year, Hanszen Orientation Week (or O-Week as we call it) has the theme of Cup of JO-Week! We chose this theme because O-Week 2018 will serve as the fresh pick-me-up New Students need to successfully embark on their journey at Rice and beyond. We are in awe of all of your accomplishments up to this point, and we can’t wait for you to create new experiences and memories as the newest member of Hanszen College! Before you begin taking classes, we want to make sure you have the chance to familiarize yourself with Rice and our wonderful college. We hope you will spend time clicking through our website (O-Week information is in the "O-Week" drop down menu on the top of this page), so you can gain some insight into our college, its culture, and an introduction to some of the first people you’ll meet during O-Week. You likely have a lot of questions about college life and what to expect, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Contact hanszenoweek2018@gmail.comif you have any questions or just want to say hi! You really lucked out by being assigned to Hanszen College, and we’re so proud to be a part of O-Week to welcome you into Rice with open arms. 
		<br><br>
We cannot wait to see you on August 12th; get ready for the greatest week of your life!	
 <br><br>
With a Hanszen Heart,<br>
Jeremiah Murrell, Karen Qi, Soohyun Yoon  <br>
Hanszen O-Week Coordinators</p>
