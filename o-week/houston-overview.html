        <p>Houston is a great city with all sorts of cool opportunities. Most of the year, the weather is great
    (though you may want to invest in rain boots and an umbrella for the days it’s not). Since Houston is the fourth 
    largest city in the country, you never run out of interesting things to see and do. The city’s massive diversity
    means great food and a variety of cultural events. If you have a car, you can easily drive to the Galleria (Houston’s largest mall),
    NASA Space Center, Kemah Boardwalk, or even the beaches of Galveston Island! If you don’t have a car, no worries! 
    You can always ride the METROrail (with a card that Rice funds for all of its students) to see professional sports 
    games, ballet/opera/symphony performances, the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo in the spring (aka the world’s BIGGEST rodeo), 
    Discovery Green park, and all sorts of hip places to eat or grab coffee in Midtown or Downtown. You can walk to Hermann Park 
    for festivals, music in the Miller Outdoor Theater, the zoo, and a great running trail. We have the Houston Museum of Natural
    Science and the Museum of Fine Arts very close to METROrail stops. You can drive (or even bike) to the Houston Arboretum and 
    Memorial Park to walk the trails and take a break from urban life. </p>
    <p>There is really never a shortage of fun things to see and
    do in this awesome city (there’s just not enough time to experience all of it!). The METROrail is expanding, friends have cars, 
    and the weather is usually good enough for biking or walking. Though Rice will be hard to leave because it’s such a wonderful 
    place, don’t forget that there is an amazing city right outside the hedges that is just waiting to be explored.</p>
